# Self-Structuring-Neural-Network


This project aims to classify a website as "Phishy" or "Legitimate" by using a Self Structuring Neural Network".
More details abou this method can be found here: http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19220/3/RamiPredicting_Phishing_Websites_based_on_Self-Structuring_Neural_Network.pdf 

The source code can be found under the directory: SRC:
1) First notebook deals with analysis using Decision Tress and Random Forest
2) The second notebook has a self structuring neural network Model for the classification.
